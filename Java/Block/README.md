First static block will be executed. Then Empty block and finally controctor block will be executed. 

Static block is run only when java class is loaded into memory. It doesn't matter in which order it's placed within the class.

Empty block and Constructor block doesn't execute without object creation. Empty block executes before Constructor block
Contructor is run each time when a new instance of a class created.
